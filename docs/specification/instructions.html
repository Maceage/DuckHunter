		<h1>Assignment - 2006 - Zombies</h1>

		<ul>
			<li>50% of the marks are a report.</li>
			<li>50% of the marks are from your code.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The assignment is a point-and-click shooting game,
			loosely based on Zombies or Duck Hunt (NES).
		</p>

		<h3>Code</h3>

		<p>	
			I have provided a skeleton application, which I would
			suggest that you use, but you don't have to.
		</p>

		<p>
			Take a look at the skeleton application in operation,
			and try clicking on the 'zombie' that appears.
		</p>

		<p>
			You are expected to build upon this functionality,
			by doing some of these:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Adding menus or buttons for controlling the game's startup,
				shutdown, restarting, pausing, etc.  Pause might be
				difficult, don't get hung up on it.
			</li>

			<li>
				Making a background image.
			</li>

			<li>
				Making the zombie more attractive, possibly even animated.
			</li>

			<li>
				Making more than one zombie appear (arrays or collections).
			</li>

			<li>
				Making the display contain other moving objects, e.g., background effects such as the sun
				moving across the sky.
			</li>

			<li>
				Adding sound (AudioClip or JMF are good google terms for this).
			</li>

			<li>
				Making the shooting itself have some graphics, e.g., a line drawn from the bottom of the
				screen to the point where the user clicked.
			</li>

			<li>
				Keeping a high score.  Note that if you want to keep this in memory, this is really easy.
				If you want to save it to a file or a database, this is harder (more marks!).
			</li>

			<li>
				Adding a splashscreen.  I know as Flash users you'll all jump at this.
			</li>

			<li>
				Multiple <b>types</b> of zombie, i.e., some with different images and some that move
				differently.  Maybe even some that are worth more points than others (maybe they move faster,
				so they're harder to hit).
			</li>

			<li>
				Improving the (frankly terrible) graphics.  Note that transparent GIFs work in Java, and most
				transparent PNGs work.  There are two types of transparent PNG, and I think Java supports one
				of them.  It shouldn't be a problem.
			</li>

			<li>
				Anything else you like!  The above are just suggestions.  Including members of staff's
				photographs, etc., are things that I wouldn't penalise.  Maybe politicians with egg on their
				face could be a theme.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			I will run your code through three utilities - Findbugs, CheckStyle and pmd.
		</p>

		<p>
			Findbugs will find likely bugs in your code, and I will look at these to see whether I can reproduce
			them as a user.
		</p>

		<p>
			CheckStyle will point out 'wrong' or bad code, and even tell me why it's bad, so I'll look at these
			individually.  Things like BADLY_naMeD___variables and useless assignments (x=x) are picked up by
			this.
		</p>

		<p>
			pmd will tell me whether you copied and pasted code from one part of your project to another.  It
			will also tell me whether you copied and pasted it from somebody else's project.  Note that under
			University regulations, ALL INVOLVED PARTIES will be penalised.  Zero is a common mark.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you copy code from sources on the Internet, you <b>MUST</b> reference them.  I have read a lot
			of code, and can quickly tell whether code looks too advanced for the student.
		</p>

		<p>
			Referenced code itself is worth no marks, but you can get marks for interfacing with it.  I will
			treat it as if it is part of the Java libraries.
		</p>

		<p>
			The final code that you submit should execute, so always keep a working copy around while you are
			developing.  It is a good idea to take a daily or weekly copy of your code, so that if you
			delete or change something you can easily look back at the differences.  Many 'diff' tools exist to
			help with the comparison.
		</p>

		<h3>Report</h3>

		<p>
			The report does not have a defined number of pages or words.
		</p>

		<p>
			The report explains the design, implementation, remaining bugs (honesty is best here), and
			possible future extensions or ideas for similar projects.
		</p>

		<p>
			Explain does not mean describe.  I can read your code, please don't rewrite it in English in the
			report.  For example:
		</p>

		<p>
			BAD: I couldn't get the Thimble to work, so I didn't use it.
		</p>

		<p>
			GOOD: The Thimble gave me an OutOfMemoryError.  I googled for Java memory profilers and found JMP (Java Memory Profiler), and I found that the bug was in the Thimble's Dongle class, which tried to allocate 15GB of memory.  I reported a bug . www.thimble.org/bugs?145235 . then the author told me I should use Thomble instead, which works around that bug.
		</p>

		<p>Note that Thimble, Thomble and Dongle are imaginary!</p>

		<p>
			So, I want to know your thought process.  Don't limit your ideas for extension to the current zombies game.
		</p>

		<h3>Code Demo</h3>

		<p>
			You will give me a demo of your game, and we will look at the code together.  This is the time when
			I will spot code that you didn't write, and we will make sure you don't submit it.  Of course,
			pmd will later check that too.
